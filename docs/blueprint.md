## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong cyan (#0095D9) evokes a tech-forward, modern feeling.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E5F6FE) complements the primary color without stealing focus, and keeps the feel airy.
- Accent color: Violet (#9D4EDD) for interactive elements; suggests intelligence and sophistication.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, is used for its neutral and modern appearance, for good readability in both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets clearly.
- Crisp, professional icon set, aligned with a modern UI aesthetic; avoid excessively decorative styles.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, like loading animations and smooth scrolling.
